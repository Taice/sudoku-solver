Sudoku Solver
=============
Usage:
------
Compiling:
`$ gcc main.c -o main`

After compiling run:
`$ ./main`

And input a 9 digit string for each row of the sudoku ex:
`1: 123456789
2: 123456789
3: 123456789
4: 123456789
5: 123456789
6: 123456789
7: 123456789
8: 123456789
9: 123456789`

The program will output a solved sudoku if there is a possible solution, it will say there isn't one if the sudoku you provided isn't solvable.

This is a self-study project, this isn't meant to be groundbreaking, it is in fact quite the opposite.
